# ShutTheBox
ShutTheBox game written in ReactJS

## How game works
- ShutTheBox is a game based on chance and trying to fill in the tiles on the board by rolling 2 sets of dice
- To begin, click the 'Roll' button to begin the game and determine initial values.
- The goal of the game is to color in (or fill) all the tiles on the board by rolling 2 sets of dice.
- If you roll a value thats already been filled in, you lose
- If you complete the whole board and fill in all the tiles, you win.
- Have fun!
